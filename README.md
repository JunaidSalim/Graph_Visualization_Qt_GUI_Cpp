# Graph_Visualization_Qt_GUI_Cpp
 This program takes density and no of vertices in a graph and then displays the graph.


**Introduction:**
This C++ program is designed as a graph analysis and visualization tool, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Qt framework. The tool generates a random graph based on user-defined parameters and provides functionalities for analyzing the graph, including degree calculation, identification of nodes with maximum and minimum degrees, display of the raw adjacency matrix, and finding neighbors of a given node.

**Features:**
1. **Graph Generation:**
   - The program generates a random undirected graph based on user-specified parameters: the number of nodes and density.

2. **Degree Analysis:**
   - Users can inquire about the degree of a specific node, find the node with the maximum degree, and find the node with the minimum degree.

3. **Adjacency Matrix Display:**
   - The raw adjacency matrix of the generated graph can be displayed, providing a comprehensive view of the graph structure.

4. **Neighborhood Identification:**
   - Users can find the neighbors of a specified node, gaining insights into the connectivity of the graph.

5. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**
   - The program incorporates a user-friendly GUI built with the Qt framework, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Usage:**
1. **Graph Generation:**
   - Enter the number of nodes and desired density when prompted.
   - The program will generate a random graph based on the provided parameters.

2. **Degree Analysis:**
   - Choose from options (a to e) to perform various degree-related analyses:
     - a) Show Degree of a Node
     - b) Find Node with Maximum Degree
     - c) Find Node with Minimum Degree
     - d) Display the Raw Adjacency Matrix
     - e) Find Neighbors of a Given Node

3. **Graphical User Interface:**
   - The GUI enhances the visual representation and user interaction with the graph analysis tool.

**Execution:**
1. **GUI Mode:**
   - Ensure that the Qt framework is properly installed.
   - Compile and run the program to access the GUI.
   - Use the GUI controls to interact with the graph and perform analyses.

2. **Console Mode:**
   - For console-based interaction, follow the prompts to enter the number of nodes and density.
   - Use the console menu (a to e) for various analyses.

**Note:**
   - This program utilizes the `conio.h` library for getch() to capture user inputs in the console.

**Example:**
   - An example run of the program is provided to illustrate its functionalities and outputs.

**Dependencies:**
   - Qt framework for GUI (ensure proper installation).
